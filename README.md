This repository provides the code for analyses performed in Johnston et al, bioRxiv, 2023. It includes code and associated files for 4 sets of analyses, plus a track file of mSTARR-seq regulatory and methylation-dependent regulatory regions:
1. Identification of mSTARR-seq regulatory regions, and their methylation dependence (MD), in K562 cells in the baseline (non-stimulated) condition
2. Assessment of regulatory activity, and MD-regulatory activity, across target loci (EPIC array, RRBS, NR3C1 gene, and background)
3. Assessment of interactions between MD-regulatory activity and environmental challenge (baseline, IFNA, and dexamethasone)
4. Assessment of relationships between methylation at mSTARR-seq enhancers and transcriptional response to flu in macrophages
5. UCSC track file (bed format) cataloging mSTARR-seq regulatory and MD-regulatory regions in K562's in baseline, IFNA, and dexamethasone conditions.
